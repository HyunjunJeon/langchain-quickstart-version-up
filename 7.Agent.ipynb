    "# Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of agents is to use an LLM to choose sequence of actions to take.\n",
    "In chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded.\n",
    "<b>In agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent\n",
    "This is the class responsible for <b> deciding what step to take next </b>. This is powered by LLM and prompt.\n",
    "This prompt can include\n",
    " - The personality of the agent (useful for having it respond in a cerntain way)\n",
    " - Background context for the agent (useful for giving it more context on the types of tasks it's being asked to do)\n",
    " - Prompting strategies to invoke better reasoning (React) is widely used\n",
    " \n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "<b>Tools are function that an agents calls</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Toolkits\n",
    "<b> set of tools </b> - groups of tools needed to accomplish specific objectives. There are generally around 3-5 tools in a toolkit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Executor\n",
    "Agent executor is the runtime for an agent. This is what actually calls the agent and executes the actions it chooses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent runtime\n",
    "TBD (Plan and execute Agent, BabyAGI,AutoGPT)\n",
