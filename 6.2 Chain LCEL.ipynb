Among the many options, I would say the best restaurant in Seoul is a small stall called \"Myeongdong Kyoja\" which specializes in handmade kalguksu (knife-cut noodles) and mandu (dumplings). The dishes are made with fresh and high-quality ingredients, and the flavors are simply delicious. The restaurant is also conveniently located near popular tourist spots such as Myeongdong and Insadong. I highly recommend trying their kalguksu and mandu for a truly authentic Korean dining experience in Seoul.\n"
